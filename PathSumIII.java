/*
for each parent node in the tree, we have 2 choices:
1. include it in the path to reach sum.
2. not include it in the path to reach sum. 

for each child node in the tree, we have 2 choices:
1. take what your parent left you.
2. start from yourself to form the path.

one little thing to be careful:
every node in the tree can only try to be the start point once.

for example, When we try to start with node 1, node 3, as a child, could choose to start by itself.
             Later when we try to start with 2, node 3, still as a child, 
             could choose to start by itself again, but we don't want to add the count to result again.
